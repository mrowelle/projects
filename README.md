A few projects on data wrangling (exploratory data analysis using python), feature selection and data modelling
You will need an IDE to run the codes, for those ending with .py extension, you may use a Python IDE like spyder for the ones ending in .ipynb, use Jupyter notebook or you may convert to any file extension of choice and run.
I also left the pdf files of the codes if you may be having issues with running the codes from the python files. You may just copy from .pdf and paste into your IDE.


HAPPY LEARNING
